The **Product Variation Generator** is a data-driven app that automatically creates fully-formatted Shopify CSV product listings from a single product catalog and a set of rule files.It eliminates manual entry for hundreds of product variations, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with Shopify import rules.

## ‚ú® Features

- \
  **Automatic Variant Expansion**Expands one product style into dozens of variants (metals, sizes, qualities) using rule books.
- \
  **Rule-Driven Logic**Uses three rule files (`Natural.csv`, `Labgrown.csv`, `No Stones.csv`) to generate variations according to whether the product has natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds, or no stones.
- **Accurate Calculations**
  - Total carat weights (center + sides).
  - Grams weight per metal using Weight Index.
  - Diamond and metal cost, labor, markup, and margin.
  - Shopify-ready variant price and compare-at price.
- \
  **Shopify CSV Compliance**Parent/child row structure, blanking of required fields, option naming, inventory, fulfillment, and Google Shopping fields are filled exactly as expected.
- \
  **Deterministic Order**Products and variants are generated in the same order as the input file and rule books.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Upload Input Files**
   - `Input test.csv` (main product list)
   - The three rule files (`Natural.csv`, `Labgrown.csv`, `No Stones.csv`)
2. **Process Each Product**
   - Determine if the product core number is **Unique** or **Repeating**.
   - Check the **Diamond Type** (Natural, Labgrown, No Stones).
   - Select the correct rule book.
   - Apply the correct scenario:
     - Unique with center ‚Üí use Metals (G) √ó Center sizes (H) √ó Qualities (I).
     - Unique without center ‚Üí use Metals (J) √ó Qualities (K).
     - Repeating ‚Üí same as above, per input row.
     - No Stones ‚Üí Metals only.
3. **Generate Variants**
   - Create all combinations in **exact rule order**.
   - Calculate total carat weight, grams, cost, price, and markup.
   - Assign Shopify option values (Metal, Carat, Quality).
4. **Build Shopify Output**
   - First row (parent) includes product metadata (`Title`, `Body`, `Tags`, etc.).
   - All child rows share the same `Handle` but leave parent-only fields blank.
   - Output saved as `Output.csv`.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

When testing, compare the generated `Output.csv` against `Output Test.csv`:

- Products are processed **in input order**.
- Variant counts match (`15338` Natural+Center must have **77 variants**).
- Titles show **min-max TCW** and **all shapes** (e.g., _‚Äú1.55-2.70 CT Round & Princess Cut - Bridal Set‚Äù_).
- Tags include category, subcategory, shapes, and **bucketed TCW ranges**.
- Carat math correct (sum of sides + current center).
- Grams differ by metal via Weight Index.
- Inventory/fulfillment fields match spec: `Qty=1`, `Policy=Continue`, `Manual` capitalized, etc.
- Prices calculated correctly with margin multipliers.
- Parent/child blanking correct.
